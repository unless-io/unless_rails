    <strong>Een kwart van de Nederlanders kent z'n buren nauwelijks. Hoe zit dat bij jou?</strong><br> Jouw Stek zorgt voor onverwachte ontmoetingen in buurten. En wat is nou een betere ontmoetingsplek dan in de tuin? Een tuin geeft namelijk een kijkje in iemands leven. In Amsterdam heeft helaas niet iedereen een tuin en worden de wachtlijsten voor volkstuinen langer en langer. Door jouw stek open te stellen, creëer je voor jezelf én een ander een super fijne plek om van te genieten. Bovendien maak je zo de stad een stukje groener! <br> <br> <strong> Mijn stek wordt ook jouw stek</strong><br> Met Jouw Stek zet je je tuinhek open voor een buurtgenoot zonder tuin, maar wel met hele groene vingers. Amsterdammers die wel wat handjes in de tuin kunnen gebruiken vanwege weinig tijd, kennis of kracht brengen wij in contact met tuinloze bewoners die dolgraag in de aarde wroeten. Door jouw stek te delen, ontmoet je mensen in je buurt en ligt jouw tuin straks vol kleurrijke bloemen of zelfgekweekte groenten en fruit. Je deelt je tuin dus met een ander!
