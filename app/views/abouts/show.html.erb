Le Wagon instigated a profound change in Michèle and she welcomed the programmer lifestyle with open arms. Her love for programming rubbed off on those around her and she was swiftly invited to be the bootcamp manager for the second batch of Le Wagon in Amsterdam. After the batch ended she started working and living as a digital nomad, teaching in multiple countries and starting her entrepreneurial career with the company 'Unless'. Together with Lars Böhm they specialize in making and mentoring products for startups.",
