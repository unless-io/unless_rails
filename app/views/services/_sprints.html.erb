          Sprints you say? I don’t much feel like running.

          Don’t worry! It’s not about sports. A sprint - in the way we do it - is based on a concept that’s developed and employed by Google. In its essence it’s a short-term, intensive way to quickly generate results. The sprint we most often emply is centered around creating a quick prototype and testing it with users, but a sprint is also an excellent way to create a great pitch. Don’t hesitate and come sprint with us!

    <p>
      It’s important to validate
      your ideas before building anything! In the conceptual stage you could still easily pivot your concept in a direction that works. Later on - not so much

      What’s the best way to find out if your idea is actually a good idea that people will end up using? You involve them in the process from the beginning. Using a sprint you can easily start user testing from the first day using basic prototypes.

      It doesn’t take months in order to do rudimentary research, you can do it in just a few days - and with limited budget. A sprint allows you to quickly filter problems and obstacles from your concept that might be a lot more difficult or costly to handle later on in the process.
