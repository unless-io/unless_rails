          Who doesn’t love some good advice? When starting out as a digital company it’s hard to figure out what your roadmap should be when creating your company. The same is true for existing companies who are looking at new features or new strategies to take their product to the next level. Advice on these topics will give you a clear roadmap on where to go next and which actions you need to take to fullfil your goals.

      What’s the best way to find out if your idea is actually a good idea that people will end up using? You involve them in the process from the beginning. Using a sprint you can easily start user testing from the first day using basic prototypes.

      It doesn’t take months in order to do rudimentary research, you can do it in just a few days - and with limited budget. A sprint allows you to quickly filter problems and obstacles from your concept that might be a lot more difficult or costly to handle later on in the process.
